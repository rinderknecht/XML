\begin{abstract}
\noindent It is common to query \XML databases using the language
\XPath embedded in \XQuery and \XSLT. The matching of an \XML document
against an \XPath expression may result in some target nodes being the
ancestors of some others, which may not be desirable in some
contexts. As a special case, when the pattern has the form
\texttt{\(a\)//\(b_1\)|\(a\)//\(b_2\)|...|\(a\)//\(b_n\)}, this means
that we want no path from the root to the target nodes \(b_i\) to be
the prefix of another. We propose different efficient algorithms to
find the \(b_i\) when the document is either a tree or a stream of
elements.
